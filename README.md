## Introduction:

Elastic is a search server based on lucene and provides a distributable full text search engine thatâ€™s accessible through a restful interface.


ElasticSearch is schema less, and uses JSON instead of XML. It is open source and built in Java, which means you can run ElasticSearch on any platform, as Java is platform independent.


ElasticSearch is a document based store. It is an alternative to traditional document stores, so it can be used to replace other document stores like MongoDB or RavenDB.


## Fast and Scalable:

ElasticSearch is incredibly fast when it comes to searching, so if your current document search is not giving you the read performance or is not scaling as well as you would want it to like, elasticsearch is highly scalable.

## Terminology:

For all those coming from traditional MySQL database, here is a table comparing elasticsearch terminology with traditional relational database terminology:
